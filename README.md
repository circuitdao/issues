# CircuitDAO Public Issue Tracker

This repository is the public entry point for reporting **bugs**, **feature requests**, and **general feedback** for all CircuitDAO projects.

## 🚨 Security & Bug Bounty

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, do **not** open a public issue here.

Submit via our official bug-bounty program on Cantina:  
https://cantina.xyz/code/8f671963-4313-4ac3-aed9-3186a240b75a/overview

Or email: security@circuitdao.com

Valid reports submitted through Cantina may be eligible for a financial reward depending on severity and impact.

## 🐛 Non-security Bugs & Feature Requests

For all regular bugs, UX issues, CLI problems, protocol questions, and feature requests:

1. Open an issue here in this repo.
2. Provide clear reproduction steps if relevant.
3. Add any context, logs, or screenshots that help.

We triage all issues regularly and move internal work into the appropriate private or public code repositories.
